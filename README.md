## Machine Learning App on Streamlit: Predict Penguin Species

ML application created using Streamlit, app takes user inputs and predicts Penguin type. 

## Key features:

* Random Forest model to predict penguin species
* Interactive Streamlit web app for easy user input
* Deployed and accessible online

## What I learned:

* Applying Random Forest for multi-class classification
* Building interactive ML applications with Streamlit
* The importance of data preprocessing and feature selection
* Deploying machine learning models for real-world use
